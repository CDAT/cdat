# CONFIGURE: gcc makes things go faster on some machines, but not everyone
# has it.  Warning: do not use gcc's -finline-functions or -fstrength-reduce
# flags, they can produce incorrect code.  (This is with gcc versions 1.35,
# 1.36, and 1.37, later versions may fix these bugs.)  Also, on some systems
# gcc can't compile pnmconvol - dunno why.  And on some systems you can't
# use the -ansi flag, it gives compilation errors in <math.h>.

# CONFIGURE: PBMPLUS's support for TIFF files depends on the library from
# Sam Leffler's TIFF Software package - see the OTHER.SYSTEMS file for a
# full description and access information.  To configure PBMPLUS to use the
# library: first, if necessary, fetch the TIFF Software, unpack it in a
# scratch directory somewhere, and move the libtiff subdirectory right here
# into the PBMPLUS top-level directory.  Configure and "make" in the
# libtiff directory.  Yes, you do have to do the TIFF make by hand, the
# general PBMPLUS make will *not* make libtiff.  Finally, uncomment the
# following five definitions.
#
# Libtiff is pretty good about portability, but there are some machines
# it has problems on.  If you run into problems, you may wish to contact
# Sam directly, at the address listed in the OTHER.SYSTEMS file.

# By the way, you must have at least version 2.4 of libtiff.  Earlier
# versions will not work.

# CONFIGURE: Normally the Makefiles build and install separate binaries for
# each program.  However, on some systems (especially those without shared
# libraries) this can mean a lot of space.  In this case you might try
# building a "merge" instead.  The idea here is to link all the binaries
# together into one huge executable, with a tiny dispatch program as the
# main.  Then the merged binary is installed with file-system links for
# each program it includes.  The dispatch routine can tell which program
# to run by looking at argv[0].  On a Sun3 under SunOS 3.5 the space for
# executables went from 2.9 meg to .36 meg.
#
# Note that if you make a "merge", the executables don't get created
# until you do the install.
