  # stride of 2, the data sub-sampled by a factor of 2 etc.. Strides
  # must be powers of two but can be independently set for each
  # dimension. Furthermore, for large data it can be useful to
  # progressively refine the data starting at some higher strides /
  # coarser resolution, ending at some lower strides / finer
  # resolution. This preserves interactivity while still providing

  # Armed with the description of the data and the request we just

  # and update the data accordingly. Therefore, one could adapt the
  # scene by simply passing different requests to this node (which is
  # what the graphical user interface does on mouse movements or
  # keyboard commands)
  
  # Create a producer node specialized to extract and axis aligned

  # Now that we have a node that will extract the data we want to see
  # we construct another node to visualize the slice

  # We want to view an axis aligned slice of the data an the
  # appropriate visualization node is one for orthogonal slices

  # For reasons internal to the underpinnings of the ViSUS system the
  # visualization node must know about the current data request. The
  # simplest way of achieving this is to attach the slice node as
  # child to the extractor 
  extractor.attachSubTree(slice,True)

  # and to inherit/share the request 
  slice.inherit(VisusSharedDataRequest.typeIndex(),True)

  # In this configuration the slice node will naturally draw the data
  # at the position of the data request which is the natural
  # place. However, by manipulating the transformation matrix of the
  # slice node we could draw the data anywhere in space / on the screen
   
  # Instead of the default greyscale color map we want to use a
  # typical red-to-blue map
  color_map = banded()
  slice.setValue(color_map)

  # In order to see the slice even if it contains no data (if the
  # request has been moved outside the data set, or the data is
  # extremly large) we draw the bounding box of the slice
  slice.drawBoundingBox(True);

  # Now, we want to create labeled tickmarks to give the user a notion
  # of the data range. 

  # Create a tickmark node that by default will create tickmarks along
  # the x-axis of its bounding box

  axis.legendText("longitude") # Set the label 
  axis.labelFont(font)         # and font
  xTickMarks.axis(axis)        # and update the axis

  # Finally, we attach the tickmarks node as a child to the
  # extractor. By default a tickmarks node inherits the bounding box
  # of its parent and thus this node will now annotate the x-axis of
  # our data set
  extractor.attachSubTree(xTickMarks,True)

  # To further enhance the scene we want to add the continental
  # outlines on top of the slice

  # First, we load the cdat internal world map 
  world_map = loadWorldMap()

  # And parse it as a collection of polylines. A VisusIndexedData
  # object stores an array of n-dimensional points (n being 2 in this
  # case) and a set of elements defined as ordered lists of indices
  # into this array. Therefore, each contour of the world map is
  # parsed as a single element
  outlines = VisusIndexedData(2)
  for m in world_map:
    outlines.constructElement(m)

  # Once the data is constructed we create a display node designed to visualize it
  map = VisusIndexedDisplay.construct()

  # And load the data. 
  map.loadData(outlines,0)

  # The cdat world map is given within (-180,-90)x(180,90). However,
  # in order to display the normal lat,long, elev data easily in
  # cartesian space we told ViSUS the data units are meters (meaning
  # general distance) which will draw (0,0)x(360,180). To adjust the
  # map to the slice we therefore must shift it
  #map.getValue(matrix);
  #matrix = matrix * translationMatrix(180,90,0.01)
  #map.setValue(matrix)

  # Attach the map as child of the extractor. Note, that from this moment
  # on the map will inherit all transformations from the extractor and
  # thus "stick" to the extractor if it is moved or rotated
  extractor.attachSubTree(map)
  
  # Lastly, we attach more annotations to the scene

  # A VisusLabelNode is a general one line text of arbitrary font and
  # size. First, we create a title string using the variable name if
  # we found one
  label_node = VisusLabelNode.construct()

  # If we found a variable name we use it as label

  # screen which means we need to make sure that the data is scaled
  # and translated appropriately. (Alternatively, once can think of
  # this step as setting up the viewpoint of our virtual camera.

  # Using the current bounding box of the scene we adapt a default box
  # to the aspect ratios of of our scene and use it as our "world

  root.getValue(matrix)

def sphereSlice(data=None,**keywords):

  """

    This function constructs a default ViSUS scene displaying a single
    z-slice through a regular block of data mapped onto the earth. The
    user can either pass a cdms2 array using the data attribute or
    enter the necessary information into the vcdat gui. If no data
    attribute is present the function will try to extract the
    necessary information from the gui and if that fails an empty
    scene will be displayed.

    The scene contains multiple \"nodes\" each of which can be
    manipulated using the keyboard and mouse. Som basic commands are

    Tab : Switch node
    Middle Mouse button : Pan scene
    Left Mouse button : Rotate scene
    Right Mouse button : Zoom in and out


    Usage: cartesianSlice(DataArray, keyword=value,...) where DataArray
    can be a standard numpy array, a cdms type data set, or
    \"None\". The function will attempt to extract a number of
    attributes from the given data or the gui each of which can be
    overridden by the user by passing it explicitly. Possible keywords
    are:

    name     : Verbal description of the data set or variable (used in the title)
    var_name : Short name of the variable  
    domain   : Physical domain of the data set represented as
               [[min_x,max_x],[min_y,max_y],[min_z,max_z]]. If
               the data is only two- or one-dimensional the extra
               dimensions will be assumed to be [0,0]
    samples  : The number of samples in each dimension represented
               as [samples_x, samples_y, samples_z, samples_t]. For
               lower dimensional data the additional dimensions will
               be set to 1, e.g. a time-dependent 2D array would be
               [dim_x,dim_y,1,dim_t]
    units    : VisusUnit identfier describing the natural coordinate
               system of the data (e.g. cartesian length, polar
               coordinates, etc.) All possible values can be found in
               VisusUnits.h
    range    : Local function range of the data. Note, that percentages
               and fractions will automatically get a range of [0,100]
               and [0,1] respectively.
